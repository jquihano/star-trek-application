## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS

This project was created to solidify the materials learned previously. Creating the API which can be found here https://github.com/jquihano/star-trek-api, was an awesome experience. Each step from writing the code for the server.js file and hosting the code on heroku to coding the routes and fetching the information from the API I wrote was particularly enjoyable.
## Optimizations
- Next features for this project are to host the database in MongoDB, rather than having hardcoded objects.
- Potentially expand database with other information from the Star Trek TV show.


## Lessons Learned:

While creating this project notable challenges were remembering the syntax required for parsing information from the API object to json. Reading the documentation helped tremendously and I was able to walk through the code that was causing errors. 
Another pain point that I've also encountered with a few other APIs are CORS errors. Through creating and hosting my own API, I realized the importance of testing all code to ensure it will work locally on others machines.
